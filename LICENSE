                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2025  Mfonido Mark

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
--------

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of
a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License, was designed
specifically to ensure that, in the case of software that runs on a
server and is used over a network, the source code remains available to
all users interacting with it remotely. If you modify this program and
run it as part of a network service, you must make the complete source
code of your modified version available to those users.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and
modification follow.
